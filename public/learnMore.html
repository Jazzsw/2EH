    <div id="essay">Gaming, particularly gaming that occupies the realm of professional “Esports” has long struggled with gender equality. The Esports sphere has a history and reputation for being a less than welcoming and inclusive environment to those who are not cis men. <br><br>
        This pervasive gender inequality, driven by toxic masculinity, pay disparities, and cultural barriers, as Lindsey Darvin puts it, not only excludes women and gender-diverse individuals from professional competition but also threatens the growth and legitimacy of the industry. (Darven et al., 2021) Addressing these issues requires a transformation of Esports culture, greater institutional support, and the elimination of discriminatory practices.<br><br>
        
        Just looking at the numbers, the disparity is apparent. Examining engagement with competitive esports titles it is clear that women make up a minority, CS:GO: 24% women, DOTA 20%, Rainbow 6: Siege 23%, and Overwatch 26% (Darven et al., 2021) and that is just interaction, the numbers get even smaller when talking about professional Esports, Hilbert estimates that the number lies around 5% of all professional Esports players identify as women (Hilbert, 2019). This significant disparity in engagement is largely due to the male-dominated environments at the highest levels of competition, where the culture and attitudes toward women are so toxic that many are discouraged from ever attempting to compete. This paired with systemic barriers to women’s competition, clearly highlights the issues at play in the industry.<br><br>
        
        
        If women do decide to pursue a career in Esports, it becomes obvious how the culture of real-life pro sports has extended into the realm of Esports. They end up in a situation similar to how women are relegated to figure skating and gymnastics, you will often see women holding roles that are more socially feminine such as “event host” and “caster” positions while men get to hold the active role as players. These roles are strictly enforced by the culture, which can be seen clearly in how the community responds when women challenge the norm in instances such as Gamergate. Gray et al. state “Gamergate, however, revealed that women, especially those who publicly oppose marginalization and symbolic violence, are met with real violence outside of these games.”(Gray et al., 2017). The existence of this culture in what - at this level - is considered a workplace, somehow goes under the radar and is rarely addressed in the context of workplace discrimination. This enforcement of gender roles furthers the idea that there is systemic gatekeeping to the highest level of play, and the use of violence as a means to enforce it threatens the industry itself.<br><br>
        
        Another large factor in this underrepresentation is the staggering pay gap between these esports athletes. For example, Valorant, which at the time of writing is the 8th most played game by monthly active players. The “VCT” is the primary sponsored league, and it has a main division (unsurprisingly with not a single woman player), and the Game Changers division which is exclusively for women and marginalized gender identities. The prize pool for the culminating Champions event in 2023 for the main division had a prize pool of 2.25 Million dollars plus an additional 20 Million in Riot merch profits going to teams. The equivalent Champions event for the GC circuit had a prize pool of half a million dollars. Given the challenges that women in the industry face, along with the mental and physical energy it takes, this lack of proper compensation for women further demotivates women from pursuing Esports jobs, and further contributes to the inequality in the industry. <br><br>
        
        Trans women and non-binary folks occupy a uniquely disadvantaged position within this ecosystem. The false ideology that they somehow possess a physical advantage over cis women in an online game has led to extraordinary amounts of backlash when they compete in women’s tournaments, yet they are still barred from main circuits facing the same discrimination and toxicity directed at their cis counterparts. Online spaces, particularly in video games, have consistently been a haven for gender-diverse people to express themselves in ways that align with their identities. An Australian study found that “Over 57% of Australian [Trans and Gender Diverse] young people reported using video games, and over 54% indicated they did so to make themselves feel better when experiencing low or negative mood.” (Morgan et al., 2020). Such a large portion of gender-diverse people play games but are being barred from competing at the Esports level further shows the control with which women and gender-diverse people are being kept out of the Esports sphere by the culture in these environments. <br><br>
        
        
        Ultimately, gender inequality remains one of the greatest issues in the Esports industry, perpetrated by toxic masculinity and systemic issues barring gender-diverse people from high-level competition. The Esports scene remains a place where women are relegated to supporting non-player roles, and face violent backlash when they challenge these roles. Additionally, the pay gap and uniquely challenging position for trans and non-binary gamers show the systemic exclusion in the Esports industry. To protect growth and legitimacy, the industry needs increased institutional support and fair compensation along with a reevaluation of the cultural and workplace environments to move towards truly reflecting the diversity of its player base.<br><br>
